  <h1 style="text-align: center; ">Architecting Microservices for Cloud</h1>
  <p>I have been a software product architect for over a decade now. The technological evolution has been phenomenal
    over
    the past few years. When internet came around in 1990s it marked the beginning of web applications with static web
    pages. Then came the client-server model with dynamic web applications. Those were largely developed using what is
    called monolithic architecture. Over the last couple of decades the technology ecosystem has evolved to create
    Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), Service Oriented Architecture (SoA), Representation State Transfer (REST)
    APIs, and then eventually microservices on cloud. Of course microservices have been around for a very long time and
    so has cloud. But the significance they have gained in the last decade is just mind blowing.</p>
  <p>If you are an application architect who wants to understand all the moving parts of a microservices application or
    know the best practices while designing your microservices this book is for you.</p>
  <p>In this book we start with what cloud strategy suits your needs and then evaluate best practices, trade-offs &
    important considerations in microservices API design, transaction management, data distribution strategies and
    security.</p>
  <p>This is not an introductory level book. For example, this book does not explain what a REST API is or what a
    transaction is. It is assumed you already know all that stuff. If you donâ€™t may be a refresher on basic concepts
    like REST APIs, transactions, data bases and security is a good idea before you start this book.</p>
